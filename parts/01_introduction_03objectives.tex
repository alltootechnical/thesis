\section{Research Objectives}

Previous attempts in the literature to provide image processing tasks such as image manipulation \cite{ziad_cryptoimg:_2016} and  facial recognition \cite{hutchison_privacy-preserving_2009} have primarily used the Paillier and  Damg{\aa}rd--Geisler--Kr{\o}igaard (DGK) cryptosystems to perform linear operations on encrypted data. In this study, we extend this research to provide an objective comparison of various homomorphic cryptosystems currently in the literature in performing non-linear operations, as opposed to just linear operations, and facial detection, as opposed to just facial recognition.

Our main research objective is to assess the practicality of various homomorphic cryptosystems with regard to image processing on faces. Homomorphic cryptosystems are known to be slower in terms of encryption, operation, and decryption time~\cite{sen_homomorphic_2013}. Furthermore, the operations on encrypted data supported by homomorphic cryptosystems are limited, and some schemes require preprocessing to be performed on images, limiting the range of operations which can be performed efficiently~\cite{li_elliptic_2012}.

In summary, in this study, we wish to
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Implement common image processing operations using known homomorphic encryption schemes, then determine which schemes admit more image processing operations and extend known cryptosystems to support more operations, if possible;
    \item Compare the time efficiency and accuracy of common image processing operations under known homomorphic encryption schemes, and of common image processing operations without using homomorphic encryption;
    \item Create a library for the Open Source Computer Vision Library (OpenCV) to allow for convenient use and comparison of these homomorphic encryption schemes for image processing and facial recognition.
\end{enumerate}
