\section{Research Objectives}
Our study aims to provide an objective comparision of various homomorphic cryptosystems currently in the literature, as they would be used in encrypted image manipulation.
In this study, we wish to
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Compare the applicability of known homorphic encryption schemes to common image processsing operations, in other words, determine which schemes permit the most operations;
		\item Compare the security of common image processsing operations under known homorphic encryption schemes, using established statistical methods in image encryption;
    \item Compare the efficiency of common image processsing operations under known homorphic encryption schemes;
    \item Create a plug-in for the Open Source Computer Vision Library (OpenCV) to allow for convenient use of homomorphic encryption schemes.
\end{enumerate}
