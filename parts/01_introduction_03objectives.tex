\section{Research Objectives}
With your context established, it is in this section where you will now describe what you intend to achieve by the end of the study. A possible way of presenting this subsection is to first introduce what problem/s you wish to address given the current context, and based on that/these, you present the objectives that would somehow address that/these problem/s. Other common things discussed may include a brief overview of your intended methodology.
