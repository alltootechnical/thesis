\section{Fully Homomorphic Cryptosystems}
\subsection{Dasgupta-Pal Cryptosystem}
The Dasgupta-Pal cryptosystem is a fully homomorphic cryptosystem proposed in 2016 by Smaranika Dasgupta and S. K. Pal \cite{dasgupta_design_2016}, which encrypts integer plaintexts in $\mathbb{Z}_n$ to polynomial ciphertexts. We begin our presentation of the Dasgupta-Pal cryptosystem with the following definition.

Given a message $m \in \mathbb{n}$, we denote
\begin{align*}
		m_p(x) = a_0 + a_1x + a_2x^2 + \cdots + a_kx^k
\end{align*}
where $a_ka_{k-1}\cdots a_2a_1_0$ is the binary representation of $m$.

In the original scheme presented in \cite{dasgupta_design_2016}, the secret key $S_k$ is set to be a large prime. In Appendix \autoref{ch:correction}, we present a case where the Dasgupta-Pal cryptosystem fails and prove that setting the secret key $S_k = 2p$, where $p$ is a large prime, corrects errors in the Dasgupta-Pal cryptosystem.
We now decribe the correct cryptosystem.
\subsubsection{Corrected Dasgupta-Pal Cryptosystem Description}
Let $\ell$ denote the security parameter of the cryptosystem.
Let $S_k = 2p$, where $p$ is a prime number with $\ell - 1$ bits.
Choose a random even integer $z$ of length $\log_2{\ell}$.

Let the secret key be $S_k$, and let the refresh key be $R_k = z \cdot S_k$. The secret key is kept private to the encrypting/decrypting parties, while the refresh key is made publicly available.

The scheme defines the encryption algorithm for a message $m$ as follows:
\begin{align*}
	E(m) = y(x) + S_k\times d(x)
\end{align*}
where
$y(x)$ is a polynomial of degree $n$ such that $m_p(x) \equiv y(x) \bmod S_k$ and $d(x)$ is a randomly chosen polynomial of degree $n$. This encrypts each coefficient of of $m_p(x)$ by adding some multiple of $S_k$ to it. Through this process, each bit of the message is encrypted separately.

Furthermore, the decryption algorithm to recover $m_p(x)$ from a ciphertext polynomial $c(x)$ as
\begin{align*}
	m_p(x) = c(x) \bmod S_k \bmod 2
\end{align*}
Thus $D(c(x))$ is defined as the integer recovered from the coefficients of the polynomial $c(x) \bmod S_k \bmod 2$

Dasgupta and Pal note that homomorphic operations on ciphertext introduce noise which may interfere with decryption, due to the potential increase in ciphertext values.
To eliminate noise from a polynomial ciphertext, the following refresh function is used.
\begin{align*}
	R(c(x)) = c(x) \bmod R_k
\end{align*}

\subsubsection{Homomorphic Properties of the Dasgupta-Pal Cryptosystem}
It has been shown \cite{dasgupta_design_2016} that the following properties hold for all integer messages $m_1, m_2 \in \mathbb{Z}_n$ in the Dasgupta-Pal cryptosystem. These properties arise since each coefficient in a ciphertext polynomial is essentially an independently encrypted bit of the original message.
\begin{description}
	\item[XOR on ciphertexts]
	An exclusive or (XOR) operation on integer messages can be achieved by adding the coefficients pairwise between two ciphertexts.
	\begin{align*}
		D(E(m_1)+E(m_2)) = m_1 \text{ XOR } m_2
	\end{align*}
	\item[AND on ciphertexts]
	Similarly, pair-wise multiplication of
	\begin{align*}
		D(E(a) \otimes E(b)) = a \text{ AND } b = ab \bmod 2
	\end{align*}
	where $\otimes$ denotes pairwise multiplication,
	\begin{align*}
		\sum_{i=1}^n{a_ix^i} \otimes \sum_{i=1}^n{b_ix^i} = \sum_{i=1}^n{a_ib_ix^i}.
	\end{align*}
\end{description}
