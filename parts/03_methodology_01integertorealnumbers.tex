\section{Secure Computation with Real Numbers}
We will briefly discuss a protocol to enable cryptosystems built for integer inputs to handle real number inputs.
The following protocol was also used by \textit{CryptoImg} for image processing \cite{ziad_cryptoimg:_2016}.

We represent a floating-point (FP) number as a pair of two integers $(m,e)$ representing the mantissa and exponent of the FP number with respect to a base $b$. The mantissa $m$ is encrypted, while the exponent $e$ is unencrypted.
Let $a,b,c$ be FP numbers represented by the pairs $(m_a,e_a),(m_b,e_b),(m_c,e_c)$ respectively. Let $\oplus,\otimes$ represent the homomorphic operations which correspond to the addition and multiplication, respectively. We define the corresponding FP number operations as follows:
\begin{description}
  \item[Addition.]
    To compute $E(c)=E(a+b)$ we compute
    \begin{align*}
      E(m_c) &= E(m_a) \oplus (b^{e_b-e_a} \otimes E(m_b)), e_c = e_a & \text{ if } e_a \leq e_b \\
      E(m_c) &= E(m_b) \oplus (b^{e_a-e_b} \otimes E(m_a)), e_c = e_b & \text{ if } e_a > e_b
    \end{align*}
  \item[Scalar multiplication.]
    To compute $E(c) = E(ab)$, where $a$ and $E(b)$ are known (i.e. $m_a$ is not encrypted), we compute
    \begin{align*}
      E(m_c) &= m_a \otimes E(m_b)\\
      e_c &= e_a + e_b
    \end{align*}
\end{description}
