\chapter{REVIEW OF RELATED LITERATURE}

We first present an introduction to the concepts in cryptography, starting from the definition of a cryptosystem up to homomorphic encryption schemes, along with some examples from the literature. Then, we present some concepts in image processing, a suitable application of cryptography, specifically the common image operations used. Finally, we present related work that attempts to apply image processing operations with homomorphic cryptosystems, as well as their advantages and limitations.

\section{Common Image Operations}

Knowing that most of the common image operations rely on addition and multiplication operations, adopting a fully homomorphic cryptosystem enables image processing operations on encrypted images without the need of decryption.

In image processing, the typical image operations being done are intensity transformations which maps intensity values to another, and the use of spatial filters to do operations such as edge detection and image blurring.

\subsection{Intensity Transformation}
Intensity transformations are typically point operations, where a certain operation is applied to each single pixel of the image. Usually, there is a function $T$ that maps a pixel value $r$ into a new value $r^\prime$, thus this transformation satisfies the relation $r^\prime = T\left(r\right)$. Examples of intensity transformations are image negation, log transformation, and power-law transformation.

Image negation is an example of an intensity transformation, where the resulting image would be similar to a photographic negative~\cite{gonzalez_digital_2008}. In this case, suppose the intensity levels of an image are within the range $\left[0, L-1\right]$, then image negation can be expressed by
\begin{equation}
    T\left(r\right) = L-1-r
\end{equation}

The log transformation is used to enhance dark pixels or increase the dark details of an image by mapping low intensity values to a wider range of values~\cite{gonzalez_digital_2008}. This has the general form
\begin{equation}
    T\left(r\right) = c \log\left(1 + r\right)
\end{equation}
where $c$ is a constant and $r \ge 0$.

The power-law transformation is a family of transformations that have the form
\begin{equation}
    T\left(r\right) = c r^{\gamma}
\end{equation}
where $c>0$ and $\gamma > 0$. This is especially useful since many output devices such as printers and display devices follow the power law, and so correcting the power-law response on these devices in a process called \textit{gamma correction} ensures reproducibility and accuracy of images being displayed~\cite{gonzalez_digital_2008}.

\subsection{Edge Detection and Spatial Filtering}
Edge detection is used to find and determine the boundaries in an image, commonly used in applications such as image segmentation and feature extraction. This works by detecting so-called \textit{edges}, areas that have abrupt changes in intensity.

Edge detection is usually done by using gradient operators that detect such abrupt changes. These operators are commonly known as \textit{spatial filter}, which are usually of $3 \times 3$ size. A common example of spatial filters is the Sobel operator, with two matrices (also called as kernels) $g_x$ and $g_y$ representing the horizontal and vertical components respectively.
\begin{equation}
    g_x =
    \begin{bmatrix}
        -1 & 0 & 1 \\
        -2 & 0 & 2 \\
        -1 & 0 & 1
    \end{bmatrix}
    \qquad\text{and}\qquad
    g_y =
    \begin{bmatrix}
        1 & 2 & 1 \\
        0 & 0 & 0 \\
        -1 & -2 & -1
    \end{bmatrix}
\end{equation}
To get the resulting image $I^\prime$, a convolution is performed between the original image $I$ of size $M \times N$ and the kernel $k$ of size $m \times n$. Now suppose that the pixel value of an image at point $\left(i,j\right)$ is $r_{i,j}$. Then, a transformation using spatial filters can be described as follows:
\begin{align}
    T\left(r_{i,j}\right) &= \left[k * I\right]\left(\left\lfloor\frac{m}{2}\right\rfloor, \left\lfloor\frac{n}{2}\right\rfloor \right) \\
                         &= \sum_{u=1}^{m} \sum_{v=1}^{n} \left[k_{i,j} r_{i+u, j+v} \right]
\end{align}

Spatial filters are not only used for edge detection, but there are also filters that do image smoothing (such as Gaussian blur and box blur, $b_g$ and $b$ respectively in Equation~\ref{eqn:smooth-filters}) and image sharpening, to name a few \cite{gonzalez_digital_2008}.
\begin{equation}
    \label{eqn:smooth-filters}
    b_g = \frac{1}{16}
    \begin{bmatrix}
        1 & 2 & 1 \\
        2 & 4 & 2 \\
        1 & 2 & 1
    \end{bmatrix}
    \qquad
    b = \frac{1}{9}
    \begin{bmatrix}
        1 & 1 & 1 \\
        1 & 1 & 1 \\
        1 & 1 & 1
    \end{bmatrix}
\end{equation}
% Should I put a table of other kernels too?


\section{Related Work and Previous Implementations}

% minor limitation: improvement on previous work, but not a direct comparison

% major limitation: does not discuss security: are modified images also secure?

There has been work done regarding the application of homomorphic cryptosystems in image processing. In particular, Ziad, et al. introduced a library called \textit{CryptoImg} that uses the homomorphic properties of the Paillier cryptosystem to apply image operations securely \cite{ziad_cryptoimg:_2016}. This shows that it is indeed possible to do various image operations in a homomorphic cryptosystem. Ziad, et al. also showed experimental results establishing the slow performance of image operations uner a homomorphic cryptosystem. For instance, while sharpening and applying a Sobel filter each take less than a second when applied to a $512\times 512$ plaintext image, when applied to an encrypted image, sharpening required at least 238.257 seconds, and applying the Sobel filter required at least 147.567 seconds \cite{ziad_cryptoimg:_2016}.

However, a major limitation of \textit{CryptoImg} is that it does not seem to tackle the problem of security. Even though the authors have established that the Paillier cryptosystem itself cannot be broken \cite{ziad_cryptoimg:_2016}, we believe that a cryptanalysis of the encrypted images after they have been operated is necessary, since image operations may be considered additional information in a known plaintext attack.

Furthermore, Ziad, et al. only presented a visual comparison and evaluation to establish the quality of the recovered images. We believe that additional image quality benchmarks, such as those presented in \cite{ahmed_benchmark_2016, ahmad_efficiency_2012}, would allow for quantitative comparisons of image quality.
This study can be further improved by also considering the use of other homomorphic cryptosystems like the elliptic curve-based ElGamal cryptosystem by Li, et al. \cite{li_elliptic_2012} and a fully homomorphic cryptosystem introduced by Smart and Vercauteren \cite{hutchison_fully_2010}, which is a variant of Gentry's lattice-based cryptosystem which can be expressed using elementary number theory, without the use of lattices.

% HElib
Another related work would be the implementation of a fully homomorphic encryption. Halevi and Shoup \cite{garay_algorithms_2014} introduced \textit{HElib}, a library that implements the Brakerski-Gentry-Vaikuntanathan (BGV) homomorphic cryptosystem. This library also makes use of various optimizations to speed up the homomorphic operations, due to homomorphic cryptosystems being slower than other cryptosystems \cite{sen_homomorphic_2013}.

\section{Summary}
We have seen how various image processing operations make use of a series of additions and multiplications. Because of this, it is possible to use a homomorphic cryptosystem in order to apply image operations directly on encrypted images, as demonstrated by the \textit{CryptoImg} library.

In particular, we aim to address the shortcoming of \textit{CryptoImg} by developing a library to test various homomorphic encryption schemes with the help of the \textit{HElib} library to be able to implement fully homomorphic encryption schemes. This helps us determine the practicality of using homomorphic cryptosystems in image processing, especially when dealing with more complex image operations.
