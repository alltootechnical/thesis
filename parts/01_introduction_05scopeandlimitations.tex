\section{Scope and Limitations of the Study}

In order for your study to be realistic, doable, and still produce a concise answer to your research questions within a particular period of time, this section provides you the opportunity to both cross-out extraneous variables, as well as set those aspects that must be controlled in your study. Some common limitation targets include the target audience for the experiment, the software to be used, portability and reusability of the software, the features it will have, and so on.
