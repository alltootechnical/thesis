\section{Significance of the Study}

This study aims to directly address one of the current problems in the research of homomorphic cryptosystems: the practicality of homomorphic encryption \cite{sen_homomorphic_2013}. The literature shows existing homomorphic cryptosystems and how they support primitive operations (usually addition and multiplication) on encrypted data, however, for homomorphic cryptosystems to be useful for practical use, support for more complicated image processing operations such as image convolution must be demonstrated as well. While implementations of image processing operations in a homomorphic cryptosystem exist in the literature \cite{ziad_cryptoimg:_2016, garay_algorithms_2014}, our study targets algorithms for which statistical tests have not been performed for image processing operations.

We wish to contribute to existing models for the secure transmission and modification of image data by developing a software library which allows the use and comparison of various homomorphic encryption algorithms. Our software library would allow service providers to perform image manipulation for clients without compromising data privacy.
