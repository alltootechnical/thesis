\section{Significance of the Study}

This study aims to directly address one of the current problems in the research of homomorphic cryptosystems: the practicality of homomorphic encryption~\cite{sen_homomorphic_2013}. The literature shows existing homomorphic cryptosystems and how they support primitive operations (usually addition and multiplication) on encrypted data, however, for homomorphic cryptosystems to be useful for practical use, efficient support for more complicated image processing operation must be demonstrated as well. While implementations of image processing operations in a homomorphic cryptosystem exist in the literature~\cite{ziad_cryptoimg:_2016, garay_algorithms_2014}, our study targets the more computationally intensive task of facial detection.

We wish to contribute to existing models for the secure transmission and modification of image data by developing a software library which allows the use and comparison of various homomorphic encryption algorithms. Our software library would allow service providers to perform image manipulation for clients without compromising data privacy.
