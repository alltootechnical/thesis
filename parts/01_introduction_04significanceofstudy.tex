\section{Significance of the Study}


If the Research Objective answers the ‘what’ of your study, this section aims to answer the ‘why’. Generally, you may address this significance in terms of its significance in the area of Computer Science and the community. However, other questions which you may also use to guide your significance are the following: “Why is your study important?” “What will your study contribute to the field of Computer Science?” “How will your study benefit not only your intended audience, but the general public, especially our country?”
