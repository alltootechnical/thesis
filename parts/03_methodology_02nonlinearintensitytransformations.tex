%We will also take note of whether or not a candidate operation is impossible to perform under a given cryptosystem.  We let $R(x,y)$ denote the intensity at coordinate $(x,y)$ in the source image, and $S(x,y)$ denote the intensity at coordinate $(x,y)$ in the resulting image. We further suppose that the intensity values of pixels are in the range $[0, L-1]$.

%	\begin{enumerate}
%		\item Image negation: $S(x,y) = L - 1 - R(x,y)$.
%		\item Log transformation: $S(x,y) = c\log{(1 + R(x,y))}$, $c \geq 0$.

%	\item[Spatial filters.] Filters implemented by performing a convolution between an $M\times N$ source image and an $m\times n$ kernel. Let $k$ be a kernel. Then the corresponding spatial filter is given by
%	\begin{align}
%		S(x,y) = \sum_{s=1}^m{\sum_{t=1}^n{k(s,t)R(x+s,y+t)}}.

%	Morphological operations such as erosion and dilation can be achieved using convolution as well.

\section{Non-Linear Intensity Transformations}
Aside from implementing the homomorphic encryption and decryption algorithms, we will also implement library functions for image negation, logarithm transformation and power-law transformation, as they are defined in~\cite{gonzalez_digital_2008}. We now describe how we implement the logarithm and power-law image intensity transformations.

\subsection{Logarithm Transformation}
The logarithm transformation of a pixel intensity value $x$ is defined as
\begin{align}
	T\left(x\right) = c \log\left(1 + x\right)
\end{align}
where $c$ is a constant.

In order to perform this transformation under a homomorphic cryptosystem, we must provide an approximation for $\log\left(1 + x\right)$ in terms of addition and multiplication operations (or their inverses). We have derived a closed form approximation in Appendix \ref{sec:logarithm_approximation}.
\begin{align}\label{eq:optimal_log_approximation_ch3}
	\begin{split}
		&\log\left(1+x\right) \\
		&\approx \frac{137x^5 + 26685x^4 + 617370x^3 - 6498630x^2 - 121239315x - 257804775}
		{30(x^5 + 405x^4 + 27210x^3 + 488810x^2 + 2536005x + 3122577)}\\
		&+ \log{16}.
	\end{split}
\end{align}

\subsection{Power-Law Transformation}
The power-law transformation of a pixel intensity value $x$ is defined as
\begin{equation}
    T\left(x\right) = cx^{\gamma}
\end{equation}
where $c>0$ and $\gamma > 0$.

Similar to the logarithm transformation, we must provide an approximation for $x^\gamma$.
We have derived an infinite series in Appendix \ref{sec:power_approximation}.
\begin{align*}
	x^\gamma &= \sum_{n=0}^{\infty}{\frac{(\gamma\log{x})^n}{n!}}
\end{align*}
Partial sums of the above infinite series can be calculated based on the closed form approximation for the logarithm in Equation \ref{eq:optimal_log_approximation_ch3}. For the implementation of the power-law transformation, a partial sum consisting of the first five terms of the infinite series were used.
