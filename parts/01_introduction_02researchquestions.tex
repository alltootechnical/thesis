\section{Research Questions}

This subsection mainly presents your research objective/s in question form. An ideal research question must be open-ended, meaning that there is no clear answer that may be readily given to it. The recommended format for this section is that you provide a single overall question, followed by a series of sub-questions (enumerate them for better readability) that help you in answering your main question.

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Research questions 1...
    \item Research questions 2...
    \item Research questions 3...
\end{enumerate}
