\section{Context of the Study}

Data privacy and security is a growing concern in various fields \textbf{[insert fields here]}. To meet these needs, cryptography is often employed to secure data. Cryptographic encryption schemes allow data to be transmitted over a insecure channel, and thus much research has been done on the development and application of various encryption schemes.

\textbf{[insert examples here]}. \textbf{[insert examples here]}.

However, recently, in addition to the secure transmission of data, there is also interest in the secure modification of data. \textbf{insert examples here}.

To allow for operations on encrypted data while maintaining data secrecy, homomorphic encryption schemes have been developed.

\textbf{[insert brief overview of homomorphic encryption schemes]}.
