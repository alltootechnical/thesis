\section{Context of Study}

This subsection of the Introduction aims to discuss the fields related to your study. It is meant to benefit your readers, especially for those who have little or no background on the kind of work your study seeks to explore. You may also briefly discuss related work to help situate your reader.
A sample context can be as follows: “The use of agents within ITSs has been the subject of continuing research at the Ateneo de Manila University.  A continuum of research work has been invested particularly in the design and development of emotionally intelligent agents for Aplusix.  Early work in the area developed models of student emotion [2], [7] as well as preliminary designs for an agent [8]. The first three studies were synthesized into a working ECA [1], with an initial capability of detecting and responding to learner affect through the learner’s interaction with Aplusix. (p.2)”
