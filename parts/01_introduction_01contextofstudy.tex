\section{Context of the Study}

Digital data privacy and security is a growing concern in various fields, such as  \textbf{[insert fields here]}. To meet these needs, various cryptosystems have been developed. A cryptosystem is a system which operates on plaintexts, ciphertexts and keys. a cryptosystem also has an encryption algorithm, which maps a plaintext to a ciphertext, and a decryption algorithm, which maps a ciphertext to a plaintext, given an appropiate key \cite[p.119]{tilborg_encyclopedia_2005}. The encryption and decryption algorithms are chosen such that the plaintext cannot easily be recovered from the ciphertext without knowledge of the key. This allows data to be securely transmitted over a insecure channel:  and thus much research has been done on the development and application of various cryptosystems.

One such particular application of cryptography is image encryption. \cite{arul_murugan_survey_2018}

\textbf{[discuss image encryption briefly, note how main concern is security]}

However, research has also considered a type of cryptosystem, homomorphic cryptosystems, where in addition to allowing the secure transmission of data, it is also possible to perform computations with encrypted data. \cite{fontaine_survey_2007}.
