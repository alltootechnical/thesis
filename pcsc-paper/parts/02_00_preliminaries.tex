\section{Review of Related Literature}

We first briefly provide an overview of the Paillier cryptosystem and describe how it can be extended to support floating-point arithmetic. We then discuss the mathematical issues with approximating transcendental functions using standard methods in the context of the extended Paillier cryptosystem.
