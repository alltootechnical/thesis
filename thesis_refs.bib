	abstract = {Machine learning algorithms based on deep neural networks have achieved remarkable results and are being extensively used in different domains. However, the machine learning algorithms requires access to raw data which is often privacy sensitive. To address this issue, we develop new techniques to provide solutions for running deep neural networks over encrypted data. In this paper, we develop new techniques to adopt deep neural networks within the practical limitation of current homomorphic encryption schemes. More specifically, we focus on classification of the well-known convolutional neural networks (CNN). First, we design methods for approximation of the activation functions commonly used in CNNs (i.e. ReLU, Sigmoid, and Tanh) with low degree polynomials which is essential for efficient homomorphic encryption schemes. Then, we train convolutional neural networks with the approximation polynomials instead of original activation functions and analyze the performance of the models. Finally, we implement convolutional neural networks over encrypted data and measure performance of the models. Our experimental results validate the soundness of our approach with several convolutional neural networks with varying number of layers and structures. When applied to the MNIST optical character recognition tasks, our approach achieves 99.52{\textbackslash}\% accuracy which significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art solutions and is very close to the accuracy of the best non-private version, 99.77{\textbackslash}\%. Also, it can make close to 164000 predictions per hour. We also applied our approach to CIFAR-10, which is much more complex compared to MNIST, and were able to achieve 91.5{\textbackslash}\% accuracy with approximation polynomials used as activation functions. These results show that CryptoDL provides efficient, accurate and scalable privacy-preserving predictions.},

Since then, numerous papers have taken advantage of Benaloh's homomorphic encryption function, including voting schemes, computing multi-party trust privately, non-interactive verifiable secret sharing, online poker... In this paper we show that the original description of the scheme is incorrect, possibly resulting in ambiguous decryption of ciphertexts. We give a corrected description of the scheme and provide a complete proof of correctness. We also compute the probability of failure of the original scheme. Finally we analyze several applications using Benaloh's encryption scheme. We show in each case the impact of a bad choice in the key generation phase of Benaloh's scheme. For instance in the application of e-voting protocol, it can inverse the result of an election, which is a non negligible consequence.},

	abstract = {Data security is of utmost importance in today’s world. Especially when the data is travelling through an insecure communication
network. There are symmetric key encryption techniques which use only one key for both encryption and decryption of the data.
They are simple in design but can be easily cracked using brute force attacks. The entire security of such a cipher could be
compromised if the attacker anyhow gets access to the keys. On the other hand, there are asymmetric key based algorithms which
use a pair of keys, one for encryption, and the other for decryption, whose security is higher as compared to the symmetric ones
but lack in time efficiency. It is also difficult to manage such a huge base of key-pairs efficiently and safely. This paper mainly
focusses on the implementation of a system capable of encryption and decryption of multimedia data (Text, Images, Videos,
Audio etc.) using a hybrid model based on the amalgamation of symmetric encryption techniques such as AES and asymmetric
techniques such as ECC. ECC is based on the toughness of the discrete logarithm problem (DLP), whose public key is short,
network bandwidth is little and ability to resist to attack is strong which makes it really difficult to guess the keys. Even if the
attacker gets access to any of the keys, he or she won’t be in a position to decipher it in a relatively finite amount of man-years.},

Our framework provides a method to perform a Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) on a user-specified signal. Using encryption of individual binary values and FHE operations over addition and multiplication, we enable a user to perform the FFT in a fixed point fractional representation in binary. Our approach bounds the error of the implementation to enable user-selectable parameters based on the specific application. We verified our framework against test cases for one dimensional signals and images (two dimensional signals).},

	abstract = {Cloud computing services provide a scalable solution for the storage and processing of images and multimedia files. However, concerns about privacy risks prevent users from sharing their personal images with third-party services. In this paper, we describe the design and implementation of CryptoImg, a library of modular privacy preserving image processing operations over encrypted images. By using homomorphic encryption, CryptoImg allows the users to delegate their image processing operations to remote servers without any privacy concerns. Currently, CryptoImg supports a subset of the most frequently used image processing operations such as image adjustment, spatial filtering, edge sharpening, histogram equalization and others. We implemented our library as an extension to the popular computer vision library OpenCV. CryptoImg can be used from either mobile or desktop clients. Our experimental results demonstrate that CryptoImg is efficient while performing operations over encrypted images with negligible error and reasonable time overheads on the supported platforms},

	abstract = {We propose a fully homomorphic encryption scheme -- i.e., a scheme that allows one to evaluate circuits over encrypted data without being able to decrypt. Our solution comes in three steps. First, we provide a general result -- that, to construct an encryption scheme that permits evaluation of arbitrary circuits, it suffices to construct an encryption scheme that can evaluate (slightly augmented versions of) its own decryption circuit; we call a scheme that can evaluate its (augmented) decryption circuit bootstrappable.

Next, we describe a public key encryption scheme using ideal lattices that is almost bootstrappable.

Lattice-based cryptosystems typically have decryption algorithms with low circuit complexity, often dominated by an inner product computation that is in NC1. Also, ideal lattices provide both additive and multiplicative homomorphisms (modulo a public-key ideal in a polynomial ring that is represented as a lattice), as needed to evaluate general circuits.

Unfortunately, our initial scheme is not quite bootstrappable -- i.e., the depth that the scheme can correctly evaluate can be logarithmic in the lattice dimension, just like the depth of the decryption circuit, but the latter is greater than the former. In the final step, we show how to modify the scheme to reduce the depth of the decryption circuit, and thereby obtain a bootstrappable encryption scheme, without reducing the depth that the scheme can evaluate. Abstractly, we accomplish this by enabling the encrypter to start the decryption process, leaving less work for the decrypter, much like the server leaves less work for the decrypter in a server-aided cryptosystem.},

	abstract = {In recent years, there has been significant development
in multimedia technologies. Transmission of multimedia
data such as audio, video and images over the Internet is now very
common. The Internet, however, is a very insecure channel and
this possess a number of security issues. To achieve confidentiality
and security of multimedia data over an insecure channel
like the Internet, a number of encryption schemes have been
proposed. The need to develop new encryption schemes comes
from the fact that traditional encryption schemes for textual
data are not suitable for multimedia data stream. This paper
presents a framework to evaluate image encryption schemes
proposed in the literature. Instead of visual inspection, a number
of parameters, for example, correlation coefficient, information
entropy, compression friendliness, number of pixel change rate
and unified average change intensity etc., are used, to quantify
the quality of encrypted images. Encryption efficiency analysis
and security evaluation of some conventional schemes like the
Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) and Compression Friendly
Encryption Scheme (CFES) is also presented. The security estimations
of AES and CFES for digital images against brute-force,
statistical, and differential attacks are explored. Experiments
results are presented to test the security of these algorithms for
digital images. After analysis of AES and CFES, some weaknesses
have been discovered in CFES. These weaknesses were mainly
related to low entropy and horizontal correlation in encrypted
images.},

Conventionally,  a  high  NPCR/UA CI  score  is  usually  interpreted  as a high resistance to differential attacks.  However, it is not clear  how high NPCR/UACI is such that the image cipher indeed has a  high  security  level.  In  this  paper,  we  approach  this  problem  by  establishing  a  mathematica l  model  for ideally  encrypted  images  and  then  derive expectations  and  variance s of  NPCR  and  UACI  under  this  model .  Further,  these  theoretical  values  are  used  to  form statistical hypothesis  NPCR and UACI  tests .  Critical values of tests are consequently derived and calculated b oth symbolic ally and  numerical ly .  As  a  result,  the  question  of  whether  a  given  NPCR/UACI   score   is   sufficiently   high   such   that   it   is   not  discernible   from   ideally   encrypted   images   is   answered  by  comparing actual  NPCR / UACI score s with corresponding critical  values .

	title = {{NPCR} and {UACI} {Randomness} {Tests} for {Image} {Encryption}},
	abstract = {The number of changing pixel rate (NPCR) and the unified averaged changed intensity (UACI) are two most common quantities used to evaluate the strength of image encryption algorithms/ciphers with respect to differential attacks . Conventionally, a high NPCR/UA CI score is usually interpreted as a high resistance to differential attacks. However, it is not clear how high NPCR/UACI is such that the image cipher indeed has a high security level. In this paper, we approach this problem by establishing a mathematica l model for ideally encrypted images and then derive expectations and variance s of NPCR and UACI under this model . Further, these theoretical values are used to form statistical hypothesis NPCR and UACI tests . Critical values of tests are consequently derived and calculated b oth symbolic ally and numerical ly . As a result, the question of whether a given NPCR/UACI score is sufficiently high such that it is not discernible from ideally encrypted images is answered by comparing actual NPCR / UACI score s with corresponding critical values . Experimental results using the NPCR and UACI randomness tests show that many existing image encryption methods are actually not as good as they are purported, although some methods do pass these randomness t ests},

Previous probabilistic encryption methods require large numbers of random bits and product large amounts of ciphertext for the encryption of each bit of plaintext. This paper develops a method of probabilistic encryption in which the ratio of ciphertext text size to plaintext size and theproportion of random bits to plaintext can both be made arbitrarily close to one. The methods described here have applications which are not in any apparent way possible with previous methods. These applications include simple and efficient protocols for noninteractive verifiable secret sharing and a method for conducting practical and verifiable secret-ballot elections.},

Since then, numerous papers have taken advantage of Benaloh's homomorphic encryption function, including voting schemes, computing multi-party trust privately, non-interactive verifiable secret sharing, online poker... In this paper we show that the original description of the scheme is incorrect, possibly resulting in ambiguous decryption of ciphertexts. We give a corrected description of the scheme and provide a complete proof of correctness. We also compute the probability of failure of the original scheme. Finally we analyze several applications using Benaloh's encryption scheme. We show in each case the impact of a bad choice in the key generation phase of Benaloh's scheme. For instance in the application of e-voting protocol, it can inverse the result of an election, which is a non negligible consequence.},
