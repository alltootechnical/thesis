Cryptography plays a significant role in transferring images securely. The exponentially hard problem to solve an Elliptic Curve Discrete Logarithm Problem with respect to key size of Elliptic Curve Cryptography, helps in providing a high level of security with smaller key size compared to other cryptographic technique which depends on integer factorization or Discrete Logarithmic problem. In this paper, we implement the Elliptic Curve cryptography to encrypt, decrypt and digitally sign the cipher image to provide authenticity and integrity.},

	abstract = {Data security is of utmost importance in today’s world. Especially when the data is travelling through an insecure communication
network. There are symmetric key encryption techniques which use only one key for both encryption and decryption of the data.
They are simple in design but can be easily cracked using brute force attacks. The entire security of such a cipher could be
compromised if the attacker anyhow gets access to the keys. On the other hand, there are asymmetric key based algorithms which
use a pair of keys, one for encryption, and the other for decryption, whose security is higher as compared to the symmetric ones
but lack in time efficiency. It is also difficult to manage such a huge base of key-pairs efficiently and safely. This paper mainly
focusses on the implementation of a system capable of encryption and decryption of multimedia data (Text, Images, Videos,
Audio etc.) using a hybrid model based on the amalgamation of symmetric encryption techniques such as AES and asymmetric
techniques such as ECC. ECC is based on the toughness of the discrete logarithm problem (DLP), whose public key is short,
network bandwidth is little and ability to resist to attack is strong which makes it really difficult to guess the keys. Even if the
attacker gets access to any of the keys, he or she won’t be in a position to decipher it in a relatively finite amount of man-years.},

Our approach bounds the error of the implementation to enable user-selectable parameters based on the specific application.

In this paper, we describe the design and implementation of CryptoImg, a library of modular privacy preserving image processing operations over encrypted images. By using homomorphic encryption, CryptoImg allows the users to delegate their image processing operations to remote servers without any privacy concerns. Currently, CryptoImg supports a subset of the most frequently used image processing operations such as image adjustment, spatial filtering, edge sharpening, histogram equalization and others. We implemented our library as an extension to the popular computer vision library OpenCV. CryptoImg can be used from either mobile or desktop clients. Our experimental results demonstrate that CryptoImg is efficient while performing operations over encrypted images with negligible error and reasonable time overheads on the supported platforms},

	abstract = {We propose a fully homomorphic encryption scheme -- i.e., a scheme that allows one to evaluate circuits over encrypted data without being able to decrypt. Our solution comes in three steps. First, we provide a general result -- that, to construct an encryption scheme that permits evaluation of arbitrary circuits, it suffices to construct an encryption scheme that can evaluate (slightly augmented versions of) its own decryption circuit; we call a scheme that can evaluate its (augmented) decryption circuit bootstrappable.

Next, we describe a public key encryption scheme using ideal lattices that is almost bootstrappable.

Lattice-based cryptosystems typically have decryption algorithms with low circuit complexity, often dominated by an inner product computation that is in NC1. Also, ideal lattices provide both additive and multiplicative homomorphisms (modulo a public-key ideal in a polynomial ring that is represented as a lattice), as needed to evaluate general circuits.

Unfortunately, our initial scheme is not quite bootstrappable -- i.e., the depth that the scheme can correctly evaluate can be logarithmic in the lattice dimension, just like the depth of the decryption circuit, but the latter is greater than the former. In the final step, we show how to modify the scheme to reduce the depth of the decryption circuit, and thereby obtain a bootstrappable encryption scheme, without reducing the depth that the scheme can evaluate. Abstractly, we accomplish this by enabling the encrypter to start the decryption process, leaving less work for the decrypter, much like the server leaves less work for the decrypter in a server-aided cryptosystem.},
