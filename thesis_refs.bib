	abstract = {Million of images are transferred everyday across the network. Some of these images are confidential and we want these images to be transferred securely. Cryptography plays a significant role in transferring images securely. The exponentially hard problem to solve an Elliptic Curve Discrete Logarithm Problem with respect to key size of Elliptic Curve Cryptography, helps in providing a high level of security with smaller key size compared to other cryptographic technique which depends on integer factorization or Discrete Logarithmic problem. In this paper, we implement the Elliptic Curve cryptography to encrypt, decrypt and digitally sign the cipher image to provide authenticity and integrity.},

	abstract = {Data security is of utmost importance in today’s world. Especially when the data is travelling through an insecure communication
network. There are symmetric key encryption techniques which use only one key for both encryption and decryption of the data.
They are simple in design but can be easily cracked using brute force attacks. The entire security of such a cipher could be
compromised if the attacker anyhow gets access to the keys. On the other hand, there are asymmetric key based algorithms which
use a pair of keys, one for encryption, and the other for decryption, whose security is higher as compared to the symmetric ones
but lack in time efficiency. It is also difficult to manage such a huge base of key-pairs efficiently and safely. This paper mainly
focusses on the implementation of a system capable of encryption and decryption of multimedia data (Text, Images, Videos,
Audio etc.) using a hybrid model based on the amalgamation of symmetric encryption techniques such as AES and asymmetric
techniques such as ECC. ECC is based on the toughness of the discrete logarithm problem (DLP), whose public key is short,
network bandwidth is little and ability to resist to attack is strong which makes it really difficult to guess the keys. Even if the
attacker gets access to any of the keys, he or she won’t be in a position to decipher it in a relatively finite amount of man-years.},

Simulation of the encryption scheme using the elliptic curve parameters proposed by Tawalbeh et al. is carried out.

schemes’ security. In this paper, with respect to the existing attacks (cryptographic attack, replacement attack and statistical model based attack), a partial encryption
model is presented, together with some secure encryption principles. Furthermore, based on the principles, a partial encryption scheme in wavelet domain is proposed, and its performances are evaluated, which proves the principles suitable for designing or evaluating multimedia encryption schemes.},

Yet, given certain trapdoor information z, it is easy to describe an ‘efficient’ function gz with domain Y and range X such that gz(y) = x and f(x) = y." (625)
In other words, a trapdoor function is a one-way function which can be easily evaluated given additional information, which is called the trapdoor.},
