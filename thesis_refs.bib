Intel  provides  a software library of these functions that can be called from both the C∗and FORTRAN*programming languages.  Byexploiting some of the key features of the IA-64 floating-point  architecture,  we  have  been  able  to  provide  double-precision transcendental functions that are highly accurate yet can typically be evaluated in between 50 and 70 clock cycles.

	abstract = {Data security is of utmost importance in today’s world. Especially when the data is travelling through an insecure communication
network. There are symmetric key encryption techniques which use only one key for both encryption and decryption of the data.
They are simple in design but can be easily cracked using brute force attacks. The entire security of such a cipher could be
compromised if the attacker anyhow gets access to the keys. On the other hand, there are asymmetric key based algorithms which
use a pair of keys, one for encryption, and the other for decryption, whose security is higher as compared to the symmetric ones
but lack in time efficiency. It is also difficult to manage such a huge base of key-pairs efficiently and safely. This paper mainly
focusses on the implementation of a system capable of encryption and decryption of multimedia data (Text, Images, Videos,
Audio etc.) using a hybrid model based on the amalgamation of symmetric encryption techniques such as AES and asymmetric
techniques such as ECC. ECC is based on the toughness of the discrete logarithm problem (DLP), whose public key is short,
network bandwidth is little and ability to resist to attack is strong which makes it really difficult to guess the keys. Even if the
attacker gets access to any of the keys, he or she won’t be in a position to decipher it in a relatively finite amount of man-years.},

However, concerns about privacy risks prevent users from sharing their personal images with third-party services. In this paper, we describe the design and implementation of CryptoImg, a library of modular privacy preserving image processing operations over encrypted images. By using homomorphic encryption, CryptoImg allows the users to delegate their image processing operations to remote servers without any privacy concerns. Currently, CryptoImg supports a subset of the most frequently used image processing operations such as image adjustment, spatial filtering, edge sharpening, histogram equalization and others. We implemented our library as an extension to the popular computer vision library OpenCV. CryptoImg can be used from either mobile or desktop clients. Our experimental results demonstrate that CryptoImg is efficient while performing operations over encrypted images with negligible error and reasonable time overheads on the supported platforms},

	abstract = {We propose a fully homomorphic encryption scheme -- i.e., a scheme that allows one to evaluate circuits over encrypted data without being able to decrypt. Our solution comes in three steps. First, we provide a general result -- that, to construct an encryption scheme that permits evaluation of arbitrary circuits, it suffices to construct an encryption scheme that can evaluate (slightly augmented versions of) its own decryption circuit; we call a scheme that can evaluate its (augmented) decryption circuit bootstrappable.

Next, we describe a public key encryption scheme using ideal lattices that is almost bootstrappable.

Lattice-based cryptosystems typically have decryption algorithms with low circuit complexity, often dominated by an inner product computation that is in NC1. Also, ideal lattices provide both additive and multiplicative homomorphisms (modulo a public-key ideal in a polynomial ring that is represented as a lattice), as needed to evaluate general circuits.

Unfortunately, our initial scheme is not quite bootstrappable -- i.e., the depth that the scheme can correctly evaluate can be logarithmic in the lattice dimension, just like the depth of the decryption circuit, but the latter is greater than the former. In the final step, we show how to modify the scheme to reduce the depth of the decryption circuit, and thereby obtain a bootstrappable encryption scheme, without reducing the depth that the scheme can evaluate. Abstractly, we accomplish this by enabling the encrypter to start the decryption process, leaving less work for the decrypter, much like the server leaves less work for the decrypter in a server-aided cryptosystem.},

	abstract = {In recent years, there has been significant development
in multimedia technologies. Transmission of multimedia
data such as audio, video and images over the Internet is now very
common. The Internet, however, is a very insecure channel and
this possess a number of security issues. To achieve confidentiality
and security of multimedia data over an insecure channel
like the Internet, a number of encryption schemes have been
proposed. The need to develop new encryption schemes comes
from the fact that traditional encryption schemes for textual
data are not suitable for multimedia data stream. This paper
presents a framework to evaluate image encryption schemes
proposed in the literature. Instead of visual inspection, a number
of parameters, for example, correlation coefficient, information
entropy, compression friendliness, number of pixel change rate
and unified average change intensity etc., are used, to quantify
the quality of encrypted images. Encryption efficiency analysis
and security evaluation of some conventional schemes like the
Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) and Compression Friendly
Encryption Scheme (CFES) is also presented. The security estimations
of AES and CFES for digital images against brute-force,
statistical, and differential attacks are explored. Experiments
results are presented to test the security of these algorithms for
digital images. After analysis of AES and CFES, some weaknesses
have been discovered in CFES. These weaknesses were mainly
related to low entropy and horizontal correlation in encrypted
images.},
